Gameplay Instructions: Work your way through the maze to find the escape. The different colors on the ground each
	represent a path with a different objective. While on one path, you may run into an obstacle that requires
	you to traverse a different path to remove. There are two power-ups in the level. One allows you to run,
	and the other is a weapon that kills enemies. To fire the weapon, press '1'. Some enemies in the maze
	follow a specific route, learn it in order to pass them (Or use the weapon). Something that can help you
	learn the enemy paths is the overhead camera. To use the overhead camera, press the 'c' key. While in the
	overhead camera mode, the player cannot move. Different enemies move in different ways. Pass the obstacles
	and enemies to reach the exit.
