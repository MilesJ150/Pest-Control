# Pest-Control by Team Pac Dot Eaters
Game for CS4455

This alpha implements one level of our game. To beat this level, the player must navigate to
the exit area- represented by a hovering green cube. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move. There
are three AI enemies placed in the level that send the player back to the spawn point when encountered.
Next to where the player spawns there is a black sphere that acts as a collectable that gives the
player the ability to run (placed in a convient location for the pruposes of the demo). We have not 
yet implemented combat, but combat will be a part of our final game. We will also and sounds to our 
enemies and character actions as well as environment interactions as recommended by the TA and instructor. 
More power-ups will also be implemented.
